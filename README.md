# Daily Streak Tracker (Desktop App)

A personal desktop application built with **Python** to track daily coding streaks
such as **GitHub**, **LeetCode**, and any custom activity.

This project is created as a **learning-by-building** project to improve my
Python programming, logic building, and desktop application development skills.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

The goal of this project is to build an **offline desktop streak tracker** that:

- Tracks **multiple streaks** (GitHub, LeetCode, etc.)
- Works **without internet**
- Saves data **locally on the PC**
- Allows **limited streak restore** when a day is missed
- Helps me stay consistent in daily coding practice

---

## 🧠 Core Features (Planned)

- Multiple streak tracking:
  - GitHub
  - LeetCode
  - Custom streaks
- Daily streak logic:
  - Same day → no change
  - Consecutive day → streak +1
  - Missed day → streak breaks
- Restore system:
  - Maximum **5 restores per month** per streak
  - Restore prevents streak reset
  - Restore count resets every month
- Local data storage using **JSON**
- Simple **desktop UI** using Tkinter
- Works completely **offline**

## 🛠️ Technologies (Planned)

- Python 3
- Tkinter (GUI)
- JSON (local storage)
- datetime module

---

## 📂 Project Phases

1. Design streak data structure
2. Implement streak & restore logic (console)
3. Save and load data locally
4. Support multiple streaks
5. Build desktop UI
6. Convert to executable (.exe)

## 📈 Learning Objectives

- Learn how to design real-world data models
- Practice date-based logic and conditions
- Understand local data persistence
- Build a complete desktop application from scratch
- Develop projects with a professional workflow
